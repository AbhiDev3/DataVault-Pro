# DataVault Pro

This is build during[ Open Data Hackathon]([url](https://www.encode.club/open-data-hack))

DataVault Pro is a revolutionary decentralized platform designed to empower companies and groups in managing and curating valuable datasets. By seamlessly integrating the Bacalhau server, improved dealClient contract, and new multisig features, DataVault Pro provides a secure and efficient solution for data collaboration, verifiable computations, and storage on the Filecoin network.

## Introduction

Our inspiration for the DataVault Pro platform came from the need to revolutionize data management, collaboration, user empowerment, and low-cost permanent files in a decentralized manner. We recognized the growing demand for a secure and efficient solution to curate, collaborate, and create decentralized valuable datasets. Additionally, we saw the opportunity to bridge the gap between centralized data pools and the decentralized Filecoin network, allowing users to seamlessly onboard valuable data onto a secure and transparent platform.

## Features

- Create decentralized databases (DBs) and request contributions from others.
- Create DB NFTs when a DB reaches a predetermined threshold of entries.
- Fair distribution of token minting revenues to DB contributors using a splitter contract.
- Verifiable computations over data using the Bacalhau network.
- Facilitate deal-making using Filecoin proposed contracts.
- Onboard open datasets into IPFS and Filecoin through the DataVault Pro platform while maintaining your own private repository of encrypted files.
- Create sharable private repositories with secure access control, where only whitelisted addresses have the privilege to add files and access encrypted contents.
- Enhanced security and efficiency with DataVault Pro incorporating Merkle trees for access control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with DataVault Pro, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
